### Result

### Performance Analysis

### Q: For each implementation, how does changing the number of boids affect performance? Why do you think this is?

### Q: For each implementation, how does changing the block count and block size affect performance? Why do you think this is?

### Q: For the coherent uniform grid: did you experience any performance improvements with the more coherent uniform grid? Was this the outcome you expected? Why or why not?

### Q: Did changing cell width and checking 27 vs 8 neighboring cells affect performance? Why or why not?
